In this lecture, you will learn what the four Object Oriented Principles are.

They are encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism. These features are common across object

oriented languages like C++, Python, C Sharp and not just Java.

We can implement the functionality of these features in any of these programming languages using classes and objects.

You'll learn the theory around these four features in the next few lectures and you will implement them

when you work on the handson lectures later on.
