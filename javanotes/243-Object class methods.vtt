Every Java class implicitly extends the Object class and it inherits various methods which you have

already used such as finalize in garbage collection, wait, notify and notifyAll in multi-threading.

In this section, you will learn three important methods which are toString, which converts an object

to string, hashCode which is very important when you use hashmap, hashset and other collections.

And finally the equals method with checks if given two objects are equal. You are going to learn how

to override these methods in your class.
