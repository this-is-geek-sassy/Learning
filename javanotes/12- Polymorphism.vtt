Last but very important,

Polymorphism. Poly means multi or multiple and morphic means shapes or behavior.

So if an object can take different shapes or behave differently when other objects access it at different

points in time, then that is called Polymorphism. In the world of Java, when you use function overloading

and function overriding later on,you will see polymorphism in action. To leave you with a real life example, me, Bharath as an object,

when I interact with my parents or when I interact with my wife, children and colleagues, I behave differently.

So the same object can output different behavior. When I talk to my parents I have more respect and when

I talk to my wife, love dominates and when I talk to my children, care, more care and when I behave with
my colleagues,it's much more professional behavior.

So the same object, when its communicating with different other objects, expresses different behavior.

This is nothing but Polymorphism.
