In this section, you will learn and use the various flow control statements. Flow control describes the order

in which the statements will be executed at runtime.

They are categorised into three sections, selection statements, iterative statements and finally transfer

statements. Under selection statements

we have the if-else block and the switch statement. Under iterative statements or looping statements

we have while, do-while, for and for-each. Under transfer we have break, continue, return, try-catch-finally and assert.

The selection statements help us do conditional execution.

The iterative statements help us loop through and execute the same code multiple times.

The transfer statements, as the name itself says transfers the execution from one point in our code to
an other point.

You will learn a lot of these in this section and some of them in sections later on.
