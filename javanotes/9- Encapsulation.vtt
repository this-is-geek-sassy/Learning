What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is about protecting the properties and the functionality of an object from other objects.

The easiest way to remember that is by having a capsule diagram just like an antibiotic medicine or capsule
that we get from a pharmacy when we are sick. Here is a capsule. That has all the properties and data

of a particular object. Then we have all the methods that can access the data of that particular object.

In most of the object oriented languages,this capsule is called a class, the data,

we call it properties and variables and then functionality or the methods can access that data.

So if other objects want to access this data, if we follow proper encapsulation, then they

always have to go through these methods and functionality to access the data in that object.

Another definition for encapsulation is writing the data and code into one single unit.

In Java we use a class to achieve encapsulation.
