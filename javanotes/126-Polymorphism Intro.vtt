In this lecture, you'll learn what polymorphism is. Poly means multi and morphic means shapes.

So if a object can take multiple shapes then it is called polymorphic.

But in the case of object oriented programming this shapes stand for behavior.

So if an object of a class can behave differently while communicating with different objects, then that

is polymorphism. There are two types of polymorphism in Java,

Compile time polymorphism or Static binding, Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic binding.

You will implement both of these in the next few lectures.
