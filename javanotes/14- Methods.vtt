You know already learned about the two building blocks that are classes and variables. In this lecture you'll

learn about methods. A method is a set of programming instructions that takes some input and produce
an output.

The syntax of a method is the return type, followed by the identity or the name of the method, followed

by the argument list and then the body of the method itself where we will be writing a lot of code to

do some work.

This argument list is the input and this return type specifies the type of output

this method is going to produce. An example,

is a simple add method which takes two numbers as the input or arguments and it produces an output

which is the sum of a and b.

So here, this is the return type.

In any programming language, the communication happens between methods. That is, methods call each other

to do some work.

For example, if you are working on a online shopping application and when the customer places the order,

the placeOrder method will be invoked which inturn can call the chargeCard and shipOrder

methods.

So these methods in an object oriented programming world can be across different classes and objects.

There can be only four types of methods.

They are methods that don't have any arguments, neither do they return anything.

They simply do some work. Methods that don't have any input but do produce some output,

methods that do have input or arguments and also give back some output and finally methods that take inputs

but they don't return back any output.

The combination of argument list and the return type gives us four different types of methods.
