When we declare a variable it is mandatory to tell its data type. The data type tells us what type of

data this particular variable can carry.

For example, int a; tells that a can hold onto integer type data. In this lecture you'll learn

about several other data types that are available in Java.

There are two main types, primitive types and reference types. Under primitive types,

we have byte, short, int, long and char which are integral type values, which can hold on to integer type

data.

char can represent single character. Although it under the integral types,

it represents one character in any language. Then float and double can carry decimal point values.

While integers carry integer type values, negative and positive, floats can carry decimal type values.

Double is double of float.

And finally boolean can carry

true or false, just two values. Under reference types,

we have classes, arrays, strings, etc; which you will see later on.

The reason we have so many primitive types is they carry different ranges of data. Within integers we have byte,

short, int and long.

So each of these carry different values or different ranges of values. Starting with byte, as the name

itself says takes one byte of memory.

So the range will be -128 to 127.

These are the values

it can carry in this range. To represent it diagrammatically, a byte comprises of 8 bits.

If we fill it all with zeros it would be a zero.

If we fill it all with 1s it will be max of 256 because it is 2^8.

But since we have to represent both negative and positive numbers, that range becomes -128 to 127. It is

-2^7 to 2^7-1.

Similarly a short takes two bytes.

So the range will be -32768 to +32767 which is nothing but -2^15 to 2^15-1.

Similarly for the other types, integer takes 4 bytes, -2^31 to 2^31-1.

Now you got the idea, long is similar as well.

So depending on the type of data you are using or your program will use, you need to use that particular

available data types.

Char takes two bytes, it represents a character.

This is the integer range for it.

More on this in the next lecture.

I will talk more about unicode, character set, etc; in the next lecture.

Float takes 4 bytes

and this is the value that it can carry.

It's an exponential value.

Double is double of float.

So it also carries decimal point values but it can, it uses 8 bytes. So it can carry bigger floating point
values.

And finally boolean, it just holds true and false,

nothing else.
