When we start working on our Java applications the very first thing we do is to install JDK. JDK stands

for Java Development Kit.

It is a software that comes with a Java compiler and a JRE.

JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. The JRE inturn has a JVM and it comes with a set of API or

libraries that are ready to use. The JVM uses Just In Time compiler to do its work efficiently.
We'll learn more about JVM and JIT in the next lecture as well.


The Java compiler that comes with the JDK converts the source code we write into byte code.


If you have worked with C or C++ you know that a compiler converts the source code into the machine


understandable code or machine code that can be directly understood with the underlying operating system.
In case of Windows its a exe and in case of Mac it's a dmg.


But in case of Java,the compiler converts the source code into an intermediate code called byte code.


You will learn the advantage of this intermediate step in the next lecture.

For a program to run, it needs an entertainment. JRE which stands for Java Runtime Environment provides

that environment for a Java compiled code or byte code to run. In C and C++,

it was the underlying operating system. The runtime environment was provided by the underlying operating

system and the machine code was directly running against the operating system. In case of Java its a JRE

which is like a virtual or duplicate operating system which in turn interprets the byte code for the
underlying operating system.

There is an advantage of this additional step which you will see in the next lecture.
The API stands for Application Programming Interface.

It provides many predefined functions that are ready to use without knowing much background details.

For example, if you want to read and write files, if you want to create new files are read from existing

files on the operating system,

you can use the Java IO library. Simply we as programmers will learn the API and then start writing programs
right away.

We need not write a lot of low level code to get our work done.
