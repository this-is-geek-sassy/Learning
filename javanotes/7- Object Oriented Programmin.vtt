What is object oriented programming? If you look around yourself you already know the answer. It is right

now you are using your computer or some other gadget which in turn uses the router

through a wifi or a direct connection to access this course.

An other example, when you access your ATM, you as an object will access the object ATM which in turn uses

another object called the banking server.

So this world is full of objects and communication between them.

If we take real life example of two persons John and Mary,

they have certain properties like age, weight and qualification and they perform certain functions like
look and speak.

They can also perform many other functions like playing games and teaching.

So at any given point in time these objects can have three things.
One is the identity or name, two properties and variables
and finally functionality and behavior.

So objects will communicate with each other using the functionality or the methods.

And when they do that communication they exchange these properties or variables, the information is

exchanged in the form of properties and variables. Java is a object oriented programming language.

The main advantage of object oriented programming language is that it's very easy to map the real world

problems to the software solutions.

For example, if we are working on a online shopping application can you tell me all the objects you

can think of when we talk about online shopping application? It could be customer,order, product, address

payment, shopping cart and so on.

So all these objects in the real world shopping application can be easily represented in an object oriented
language like Java.

Similarly if we consider a Hospital Management software or application, can you think of the objects? Yep!

Patient, an appointment with the doctor and the doctor itself or himself, herself, prescription and then

the billing information at the end of it ofcourse, they will bill you for sure.

So all these objects once again, can be easily mapped to the programming language and we can easily develop
a software solution using the Object Oriented Programming.
