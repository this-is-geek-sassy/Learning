In the very first section you have learnt that encapsulation is the process of binding the data and

code together or properties and methods together so that only those methods can access those properties.

For example, if I have a Customer class to implement encapsulation, we will first mark all the fields on

that class as private, so that no other class can directly access those fields.

We then define the accessor methods called getter methods and setter methods for each field.

These methods are public. In order to set the credit card information here to a value,

the other classes will have to invoke the setCreditcard method on the Customer object and pass in a

creditcard.

Similarly if they want to get the value of the creditcard, they'll have to invoke the getCreditcard method.

They can't directly use the creditcard.

That is how we achieve encapsulation.

There are two major advantages of encapsulation.

Number one is secured security.

Number two, easy enhancements.

I'll talk more about it when you implement this encapsulation handson in the next lecture.
