Inheritance is the process of defining a new object with the help of an existing object. In Java
we use the keyword extends to inherit.

Let's take a look at two important things in inheritance with an example.

Now that we have IPhone 6s in the market, pretty soon the proposed next IPhone is IPhone 7 which can definitely

extend from IPhone 6s and it can use a lot of features from 6s.

So the two important things in inheritance are accessing the existing object's functionality.

So IPhone 7 can use a lot of behavior in IPhone 6s, the way we take the pictures,

the way we record the videos,the way we access our email and a lot of other features can still remainthe same in

IPhone 7. At the same time it can update the existing functionality in 6s.

The camera could be better,

IPhone 7 could be better performing, etc. And two other terms that we usually hear when we talk

about inheritance are Reusability and IS-A-relationship.

Let's take another example. When we have BMW and Audi which are ofcourse both cars.

They have something in common which every car has.

So these two can reuse something from the car object.

Similarly we have Volvo and Benz which are bus companies and they both have some common behavior which
can go into a bus and they can inherit from the bus object.

Now does car and bus have something in common?
Ofcourse.

So we can push that common functionality into an object called vehicle.

This way we're going to reuse all the common functionality from the vehicle.

The common functionality will go into the car and the bus and from the car, the common functionality

can go into BMW and Audi. Similarly from the bus,

the common functionality can go into Volvo and Benz.

All these companies can implement different things in their own fashion. So they first try to use whatever

comes from the bus and then they implement their own things.

That is reusability.

Finally, the IS-A is just a term used to refer to inheritance.

So in this case, a car is a vehicle, a bus is also a vehicle and then a BMW is a car.

You can't say an Audi
is a bus.

So is-a is just a terminology that we usually use to refer to inheritance.
