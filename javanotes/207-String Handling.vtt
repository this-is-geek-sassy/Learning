Strings are a bunch of characters.

For example, in name like Bharath or an awesome quotation such as, You are the creator of your destiny.

In Java, these strings are represented as objects of the class String. The String class belongs to

java.lang

package. It provides various useful methods like length which will tell us the number of characters in

the string,

concat, which can concatenate two strings, split, which can split the string into multiple tokens or strings

given a delimiter. There are several other useful methods on the String which you will be exploring
in the lectures later on.
